            <em><strong>Boxing</strong></em> (also known as "western boxing" or
            "pugilism") is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing
            protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps
            and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined
            amount of time in a boxing ring. More generally, the term "boxing"
            can refer to any combat sport in which two opponents face each other
            in a fight using their fists, covered by gloves in most cases, and
            differentiated according to their rules, such as western boxing,
            French boxing, Chinese boxing, Thai boxing, kickboxing, and the
            ancient pygmachia.

            <em><strong>basketball</strong></em> is a team sport in which two
            teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
            rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a
            basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through
            the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted
            10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court)
            while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own
            hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the
            three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play
            stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul
            is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the
            most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play
            expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime)
            is mandated.

            <em><strong>Football</strong></em> is a professional American
            football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the
            National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football
            Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major North American
            professional sports leagues and the highest professional level of
            American football in the world.[2] Its eighteen-week regular season
            runs from early September to early January, with each team playing
            seventeen games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of
            the regular season, seven teams from each conference (four division
            winners and three wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a
            single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, which
            is usually held on the first Sunday in February and is played
            between the champions of the NFC and AFC. The league is
            headquartered in New York City.

            <em><strong>Futbol</strong></em>
            is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking
            a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally
            means the form of football that is the most popular where the word
            is used. Sports commonly called football include association
            football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron
            football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
            Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic
            football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent
            common origins and are known as football codes.
